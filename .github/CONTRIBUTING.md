# Introduction

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to this project. Hibana is made up of many contributions by the people like you.

Development with common guidelines makes your reports, requests, claims and changes easy to communicate to other developers. Only when you follow these guidelines can you contribute Hibana.

Hibana is an open source project and we love  **Free** (in other words, **Libre**). You can contribute to Hibana in many ways. Submitting bug reports and feature requests, creating PRs, improving documentation, writing tutorials or introducing Hibana are all examples of helpful contributions.

Again, development with common guidelines means less work for you. For instance, please use templates if submitting issues or creating PRs.

Please also read this [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/student-kyushu/hibana/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Hibana? You can start by looking for help-wanted issues. (If you're a member of KSA and want to develop with us, please tell the managers that on Discord.)

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Don't hesitate to contribute and ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.🐣
